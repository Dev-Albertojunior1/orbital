# Space Objects Visualizer

A React-based web application that visualizes space objects, including satellites, asteroids, debris, and comets, in 3D using the `three.js` library. The app fetches data from NASA's public API and visualizes space objects' orbits around Earth.

## Features

- **3D Visualization**: The app uses `react-three/fiber` and `three.js` to create an interactive 3D representation of space objects in orbit around Earth.
- **NASA API Integration**: Fetch space object data from NASA's API and display it on the 3D canvas.
- **Collision Prediction**: Predict and visualize potential collisions between space objects using orbital mechanics calculations.
- **Interactive UI**: Click on space objects to get more information, with filters to toggle object types (satellites, asteroids, debris, comets).
- **Data Statistics**: Display real-time statistics and charts about space objects' types, average orbit radius, and speed.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (>= 16.0.0)
- npm or yarn

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/space-objects-visualizer.git
   cd space-objects-visualizer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Or using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

4. Visit the app at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Project Structure

- `src/components/`: Contains reusable UI components such as alerts, charts, and 3D objects.
- `src/hooks/`: Custom hooks for managing state and fetching data.
- `src/pages/`: Main app logic and scene components.
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions for collision detection and data handling.
- `public/`: Static assets including textures for 3D objects.

## How it Works

1. **Fetching Data**: The app fetches space object data from NASA's API (`https://data.nasa.gov/resource/b67r-rgxc.json`), which provides details about asteroids, comets, and other space objects.
   
2. **3D Orbit Visualization**: The objects are rendered as orbits around Earth. The positions of these objects are calculated based on their orbital radius, speed, and inclination. The app visualizes these objects using `react-three/fiber`, with interactive controls to rotate and zoom in on the 3D scene.

3. **Collision Detection**: The app predicts collisions between space objects using basic orbital mechanics and calculates potential collision times.

4. **Charts and Stats**: Using the `recharts` library, the app displays statistics about object types (count, average orbit radius, and speed) in the form of line charts.

## Key Components

- **`Earth`**: The central body representing Earth, using a textured sphere.
- **`SpaceObject`**: Represents each space object, with properties such as type, speed, orbit radius, and more. Objects are animated in orbits around Earth.
- **`Scene`**: The main 3D scene that holds all objects, Earth, lights, and cameras.
- **`ObjectTypeDistribution`**: Displays a chart with space object statistics.

## Dependencies

- `react-three/fiber`: A React renderer for `three.js` that makes it easy to create 3D graphics in React.
- `@react-three/drei`: A collection of useful helpers and abstractions for `react-three/fiber`.
- `three`: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics.
- `recharts`: A chart library for displaying statistics and data visualizations.

## Usage

1. **Interact with Space Objects**: Click on space objects to get more information about them.
2. **Zoom and Rotate**: Use mouse controls to zoom in and rotate the 3D scene.
3. **Filter Objects**: Filter the objects shown based on their types (satellite, asteroid, debris, comet).
4. **Collision Detection**: The app visualizes possible collisions between objects in real-time.
